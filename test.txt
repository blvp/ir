first indigenous president, set Sunday as the date for a referendum to allow him to run for a fourth term, victory seemed likely. The fiery leftist and former coca grower was popular. His campaign’s pitch: “Without Morales, the sun will hide and the moon will escape.”

Bolivians, however, appear to have other ideas about his presidency.

In recent months, Mr. Morales has been abandoned by his once-loyal constituents, coca growers, peasants and indigenous organizations who say he no longer represents them.

He has struggled to explain the scandalous revelations of an illegitimate child, angering many in this predominantly Roman Catholic country.

And last week, a mob burned six people to death at the city hall in El Alto, the nation’s second-largest city. Among those arrested in connection with the fire: a former candidate from Mr. Morales’s party.

Mr. Morales, 56, now struggles to defend his legacy against opponents who say that after a decade in power, he has become another Latin American strongman. Polls ahead of the vote show support for the referendum slipping, though many voters remain undecided.
